# homebrew-bottom

---

**This repo is now archived and will not get updates anymore - bottom is [officially available on homebrew core](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/Formula/bottom.rb), so there isn't really any need for this repo anymore.**

**Update 2021/10/10: The formula is now disabled - please don't use this anymore, just install from core:**

```bash
brew install bottom
```

**Thanks!**
