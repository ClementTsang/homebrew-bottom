    def caveats
      <<~EOS
        Note that bottom might require elevated privileges to correctly display information for all processes. You
        probably won't need it though, there are built-in methods to avoid this need.
        If you find you really do need it, you can do this with `sudo btm`.
        You should be certain that you trust any software you grant root privileges.
